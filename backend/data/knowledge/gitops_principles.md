# GitOps Core Principles

GitOps is the practice of using Git as the single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and application delivery.

## 1. Declarative Configuration
- All infrastructure and deployment configurations must be stored as code in a Git repository.
- Agents or pipelines apply these configurations automatically when changes are merged.

## 2. Versioned and Immutable
- Every desired state change is represented as a commit.
- Rollbacks are achieved by reverting commits, not manual configuration changes.

## 3. Automated Delivery
- Continuous delivery agents watch the repository and apply updates automatically when PRs are merged.
- Manual deployment steps should be minimal.

## 4. Observability and Feedback
- Each deployment must produce observable outputs (logs, metrics, dashboards).
- The system must report deployment state back into Git (via issues or PR comments).

## 5. Security and Access
- Git-based access control ensures only approved changes are applied.
- Deployment keys, secrets, and pipelines must be managed securely.

## 6. Roles in GitOps Automation
- **Commit Agent:** Creates or updates config files and ensures valid commit messages.
- **Branch Manager Agent:** Manages automation branches, ensuring safe and trackable updates.
- **Deployment Agent:** Watches for merges to main and triggers pipeline execution.
- **Report Agent:** Collects deployment and activity metrics and produces compliance reports.

These principles enable reproducible, auditable, and self-healing infrastructure automation.
